I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Virginia and on the job market for the 2025-2026 academic year. My research interests are in applied microeconomics, with a focus on development, political economy, and environment. My job market paper focuses on understanding how economic ideas can affect principal-agent alignment in the public sector.

<!-- In general, much of my work focuses on econometric analyses of novel data, often constructed from archival records or imputed from text with modern natural language processing tools, in settings which allow for causal inference from observational data. -->

 I expect to graduate in May 2026. You can contact me at [enr2ac@virginia.edu](mailto:enr2ac@virginia.edu).
