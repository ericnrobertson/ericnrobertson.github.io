I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Virginia and on the job market for the 2025-2026 academic year.

My research interests are in applied microeconomics, with a focus on development, political economy, and environment. My job market paper examines how economic ideas affect the policies implemented by civil servants.

<!-- In general, much of my work focuses on econometric analyses of novel data, either collected from the field, constructed from archival records, or imputed from text using natural language processing tools. I primarily examine settings which allow for causal inference from observational data. -->

 I expect to graduate in May 2026. You can contact me at [enr2ac@virginia.edu](mailto:enr2ac@virginia.edu).
